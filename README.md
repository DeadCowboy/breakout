Breakout Game
=============

This breakout style game was my first [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) experiment. Using HTML5 Web Sockets via [SocketIO](http://socket.io/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) to serve pages, I passed accelerometer data from my phone browser to my desktop browser essentially making the phone a wireless controller for the game.

The breakout game itself was created using [CreateJS](http://createjs.com/).

Unfortunately, the server hosting this experiment is down.  However, a video of it in action can be seen here, [HTML5 / NodeJS Breakout Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCaY__dF36Q).
